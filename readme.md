## Installation

##### YOU'RE GOING TO NEED TO MAKE A SUBDOMAIN!
Here's a guide on how to make one for cPanel
[CLICK ME!](https://documentation.cpanel.net/display/ALD/Subdomains)

Set the subdomain to crew.yourva.com or fly.yourva.com etc.


Upload the entire .zip onto your webserver (* ONLY if you are using cPanel or any other online FTP service with an extract function*) if not, extract all the files there or on your desktop and upload each file manually via. a FTP program such as [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org) or [CyberDuck](https://cyberduck.io/?l=en)

Shove the phpVMS installation into the subdomains folder and leave all other folders out of there and in the main directory (public_html).

phpVMS Installation is pretty straight forward... Once the files are up there just head to crew.yourva.com and follow through with the steps.

If you need to know how to make an SQL database via. cPanel [CLICK HERE!](https://documentation.cpanel.net/display/ALD/MySQL+Databases)

After CrewCenter is installed, if you head to your main domain (yourva.com) you should see the site. A lot of links will need to be changed (This is the part where you need that general knowledge of HTML, if you can't be bothered... Get a mate who has that knowledge to help you out)

From there you should have your new Virtual Airline.
